This is a lovelace plugin that allows you to define rackable equipment, along with their front and rear images.  The equipment can be stacked.  

Each equipment can optionally specify its "rollup" status entity. If provided an LED is positioned alongside the equipment indicating whether the equipment is healthy or not.

Each equipment can also provide a tap action.
